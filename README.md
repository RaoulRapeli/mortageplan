# mortageplan

mortageplan is my Code Test for Crosskey.


## Installation

On Github, click up right on 'code' and then 'Download Zip'. 

Extract files

Open the project with a proper compiler (Apachne NetBeans for example)

Build the project.

Now you can run the .jar file under \target through terminal. Or run it through Apachne NeatBeans.

It should show the following:

```bash
Prospect 1: Juha wants to borrow 1000,00 € for a period of 2 years and pay 42,76€ each month 
Prospect 2: Karvinen wants to borrow 4356,00 € for a period of 6 years and pay 60,88€ each month

Prospect 4: Clarencé Andersson wants to borrow 2000,00 € for a period of 4 years and pay 42,95€ each month 
Press Enter key to continue...
```
Click 'Enter' to close the program.

## Adding more prospects

To add more prospects to the list, head down to src\main\resources and edit the 'prospects.txt' file

Save the text file, run the program again to see that it's working.
